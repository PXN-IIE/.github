## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# DE Institute of Information and Engineering,PXN, AKA PXN-IIE.
IIE is committed to encouraging project team members to practice their small ideas and try out their own plugins (as long as they are CPU friendly, it should be enough)
Share your own ideas, discuss the forefront of informatics, and develop for the future.

## Main Task (Now DAY)
developing and maintaining  the forum of PXN.

## Side Quest (Always)
Enjoy the fun of collaborative development!

## How to contribute to a project within an organization
The author of each project will provide a README file that is specific to the project. Please carefully read the development manual provided and contribute to the project through the standard process of submitting questions and pulling requests. (This is not only a respect for others, but also a requirement for oneself.)
